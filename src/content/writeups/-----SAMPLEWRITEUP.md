## FORMATTING RULES IMPORTANT TO READ PLEASE!

### Frontmatter

The frontmatter is the content above this wrapped in `---`'s, please make sure that the following apply:
- The `author` you use is consistent across all your current and future writeups
- The `ctf` is in the format `<CTF NAME> <YEAR>`, for e.g. `PicoCTF 2025`.
- The `category` should be all lowercase and check the existing categories before making a new one, if a new one is made there may be disputes over its validity or how required it is.
- The `description` should contain the challenge description for the CTF, if it is lost and can't be found utilise a brief synopsis of the challenge instead
- The `section` should be `CTFs` and perhaps `PicoCTF` or `HackTheBox` for machine/challenge writeups.
- The `image` for the CTF should be in the `images` folder for the CTF content and should be the icon for the CTF. For non-CTF challenges (like one-off PicoCTF challenges) should strive to use an image to make it recognisable.

### Writing Style
You can write pretty much however you want, but we have a few main (loose) rules:
- **Accuracy**: Information you portray, and the solution and explanation for your solutions should be accurate information (atleast at the time of writing). You are demonstrating your understanding to the reader and it should be expressed clearly and well. Don't make things up you don't know, check.
- **Quality**: Make it good lol, very simple, if the writeup clearly has no effort or work put into it we won't care. Make it good!
- **Unique**: 

hello there this is my aweosme writeup
```
code block
```

`code`

**bold** (ooh)

*italic* (aah)

__underline__ (waow)
