I didn't get any photos of this one but this was an onsite challenge (denoted by the `*` at the end of the challenge name). You were given a piece of paper and a plastic water bottle. Replicating what is known as a [Scytale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale) you can wrap the paper around and form the flag readind from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
