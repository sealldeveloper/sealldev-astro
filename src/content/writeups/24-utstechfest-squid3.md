The intended route for this was to trigger a reverse shell from the `/script` panel and then use `su root` to read the flag in the `/root` folder, but the connections never worked, so I reached out to the admin.

I was told a reverse shell was the correct process, but was broken. They gave me the flag as I had 'solved' the challenge.

Flag: `CSEC{J3nkin3_un4u7h3d_70_r007}`
