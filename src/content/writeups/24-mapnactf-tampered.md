description: "Our MAPNA flags repository was compromised, with attackers introducing one invalid flag.

Looking through the given files, we are given a very long list of flags.

Basics scan show nothing out of the ordinary in flag format or length, so I look into the newlines after each flag.

I write a basic script to split all lines by the common ending `\r\r\n` and if any of the strings don't meet the expected length, to print them.

```python
with open('flags.txt','rb') as f:
    d=f.read().split(b'\r\r\n')
    for x in d:
        if x != b'':
            if len(x) != 47:
                print(x)
```

```
$ python3 check.py
b'MAPNA{Tx,D51otN\\eUf7qQ7>ToSYQ\\;5P6jTIHH#6TL+uv}\r\n\rMAPNA{R6Z@//\\>caZ%%k)=ci3$IyOkSGK%w<"V7kgesY&k}â€™
```

We can see one flag ends with `\r\n\r`, which is our out of place flag.

Flag: `MAPNA{Tx,D51otN\\eUf7qQ7>ToSYQ\\;5P6jTIHH#6TL+uv}`
