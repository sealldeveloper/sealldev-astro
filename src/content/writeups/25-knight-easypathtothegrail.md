We are given a `grail.knight` which is an ELF binary again:

We have a few functions and of interest are `main`, `transform_input` and `do_fight`.

The snippet of `main` doing the flag check is:

```c
    transform_input(local_198,local_118);
    iVar1 = strcmp(local_118,"D2C22A62DEA62CCE9EFA0ECC86CE9AFA4ECC6EFAC6162C3636CC76E6A6BE");
    if (iVar1 == 0) {
      printf("Correct! The flag is %s\n",(char *)local_198);
    }
    else {
      puts("Wrong password!");
    }
```

`local_198` is the user input so we need to look at what `transform_input` is doing with `local_118`.

```c
void transform_input(byte *param_1,char *param_2)

{
  byte bVar1;
  char *local_28;
  byte *local_20;

  local_28 = param_2;
  for (local_20 = param_1; *local_20 != 0; local_20 = local_20 + 1) {
    bVar1 = do_fight(*local_20);
    sprintf(local_28,"%02X",(uint)bVar1);
    local_28 = local_28 + 2;
  }
  *local_28 = '\0';
  return;
}
```

This (in essence) is hex encoding a string byte by byte but running `do_fight` on each byte each iteration before hex encoding.

```c

byte do_fight(byte param_1)

{
  undefined local_1c;
  undefined local_d;
  undefined4 local_c;

  local_d = 0;
  local_1c = param_1;
  for (local_c = 0; local_c < 8; local_c = local_c + 1) {
    local_d = local_d << 1 | local_1c & 1;
    local_1c = local_1c >> 1;
  }
  return local_d;
}

```

This is taking the input byte, then reversing the order of its bits. `local_d` is shifted left once then the rightmost bit of `local_1c` is extracted. This new extracted bit is added to `local_d` using `|` (OR). `local_1c` is then shifted right by 1 to process the next one. This is repeated 8 times (for each bit in the byte).

e.g. `10110011` becomes `11001101`.

So the overall functionality is taking a string, getting each byte, reversing the bit order and then hex encoding it.

So to undo it we need to:

- Hex Decode the string
- Reverse the bits

I do this in Python:

```python
def do_fight(byte):
    result = 0
    for _ in range(8):
        result = (result << 1) | (byte & 1)
        byte = byte >> 1
    return result

def reverse_transform(hex_string):
    result = bytearray()
    for i in range(0, len(hex_string), 2):
        hex_byte = hex_string[i:i+2]
        byte_val = int(hex_byte, 16)
        original = do_fight(byte_val)
        result.append(original)
    return bytes(result)

target = "D2C22A62DEA62CCE9EFA0ECC86CE9AFA4ECC6EFAC6162C3636CC76E6A6BE"
flag = reverse_transform(target)
print(f"Decoded flag: {flag.decode()}")
```

This outputs:

```bash
$ python3 script.py
Decoded flag: KCTF{e4sy_p3asY_r3v_ch4ll3nge}
```

Flag: `KCTF{e4sy_p3asY_r3v_ch4ll3nge}`
