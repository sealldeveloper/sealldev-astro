We are given a `Look_at_me.jpg`:
![Look_at_me.jpg](images/25-kashi/Look_at_me.jpg)

Originally tried _a lot_ of stego techniques and got nowhere...

I decided to reverse image searched the image as the icon looked familiar, was for a stego program 'SilentEye'.

I download the tool onto my Windows box and get the flag.
