title: "Memories Bring Back You"
description: 'A collection of images, a digital time capsule—preserved in this file. But is every picture really just a picture? A photographer once said, "Every image tells a story, but some stories are meant to stay hidden." Maybe it’s time to inspect the unseen and find what’s been left behind.'

I used Autopsy on the image, looking through the 'by Extension' field, there are ALOT of images. I scroll through and notice one has an out of place file name that contained the flag.
